    <!-- STORY -->
    <p> New York State is known for its beautiful parks that are frequented by visitors and tourists alike. New York has just released the data showing state park visitors for the year 2020, and it appears that the park was a sanctuary for many. </p>

    <p> New York City has a few state parks within its region. Analyzing the data from four of the parks, including Bayswater Point State Park, Gantry Plaza Park, Heckscher State Park, and Jones Beach Park, showed that people were not deterred from visiting parks amidst the Covid-19 pandemic. </p>

    <p> After having just over 8 million visitors total in these four parks in the year 2017, over 11 million visitors flocked to these parks in 2020, even with the pandemic. **INSERT QUOTE ABOUT VISITORS AMIDST THE PANDEMIC.** </p>

<p> As much bad as Covid-19 brought, it is nice to see that some people used it as an opportunity to connect with nature! </p>
